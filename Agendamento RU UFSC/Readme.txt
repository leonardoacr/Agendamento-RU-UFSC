--- Install Puppeteer: npm i

At some time ago the university I study (Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil) was asking to make it necessary an appointment to have acess to the restaurant. I got tired of it and made this app that did the appointment everyday for me. 

Nowadays it is not necessary anymore because they changed the system, still I decided to make this repository to show what I did :)
